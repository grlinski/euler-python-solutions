# Trying the mod % way this time
# I copied the 2**7830457 incorrectly in the original
# It has been changed and now works.



# The largest Non-Mersenne Prime
# 28433Ã—2**7830457+1
# Find the last ten digits of this number.
"""
I'm going to attempt brute force computing
However I only need to technically worry about storing the last ten digits

So I can just multiply 2 by itself 7830457 times, storing only the last ten digits
Then multiply it again by 28433 and add one.
